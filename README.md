# Half-Life 1.1.1.0 MP3 Fix

Small ASI plugin that fixes the issue with not playing correct MP3 files when playing expansion packs/mods with the old pre-Steam version of Half-Life.
For example, you would always hear the Half-Life soundtrack even if playing Half-Life: Opposing Force.

Ability to play MP3 files as a substitute for playing soundtrack from CD first appeared with patch 1.1.0.8. It was an undocumented feature that only
became official with Steam version of Half-Life. Please refer to your Steam Half-Life installation directoy to see how files should be named:

### Half-Life

\steamapps\common\half-life\valve\media

### Half-Life: Opposing Force

\steamapps\common\half-life\gearbox\media

### Half-Life: Blue Shift

\steamapps\common\half-life\bshift\media
